Although both encoding and compression are designed to improve storage efficiency, encoding techniques are usually available only for specific data types (e.g., second-order differential encoding is only suitable for INT32 or INT64 data type, and storing floating-point numbers requires multiplying them by 10m to convert to integers), after which the data is converted to a binary stream. The compression method (SNAPPY) compresses the binary stream, so the use of the compression method is no longer limited by the data type.</p><h2 id="basic-compression-methods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-compression-methods"><span>Basic Compression Methods</span></a></h2><p>IoTDB allows you to specify the compression method of the column when creating a time series, and supports the following compression methods:</p><ul><li><p>UNCOMPRESSED</p></li><li><p>SNAPPY</p></li><li><p>LZ4</p></li><li><p>GZIP</p></li><li><p>ZSTD</p></li></ul>',5),d=e("h2",{id:"compression-ratio-statistics",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#compression-ratio-statistics"},[e("span",null,"Compression Ratio Statistics")])],-1),h=e("p",{memtable_flush_time:""},"Compression ratio statistics file: data/system/compression_ratio/Ratio-{ratio_sum}-",-1),u=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"ratio_sum: sum of memtable compression ratios"),e("li",null,"memtable_flush_time: memtable flush times")],-1),f=e("p",null,[t("The average compression ratio can be calculated by "),e("code",null,"ratio_sum / memtable_flush_time")],-1);function g(y,_){const o=i("RouteLink");return a(),n("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[t("The specified syntax for compression is detailed in "),r(o,{to:"/UserGuide/V1.1.x/Reference/SQL-Reference.html"},{default:c(()=>[t("Create Timeseries Statement")]),_:1}),t(".")]),d,h,u,f])}const C=s(m,[["render",g],["__file","Compression.html.vue"]]),T=JSON.parse('{"path":"/UserGuide/V1.1.x/Data-Concept/Compression.html","title":"Compression","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Compression When the time series is written and encoded as binary data according to the specified type, IoTDB compresses the data using compression technology to further improve...","head":[["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/UserGuide/V1.1.x/Data-Concept/Compression.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V1.1.x/Data-Concept/Compression.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"IoTDB Website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Compression"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Compression When the time series is written and encoded as binary data according to the specified type, IoTDB compresses the data using compression technology to further improve..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Compression\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Basic Compression Methods","slug":"basic-compression-methods","link":"#basic-compression-methods","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Compression Ratio Statistics","slug":"compression-ratio-statistics","link":"#compression-ratio-statistics","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1688958677000,"updatedTime":1688958677000,"contributors":[{"name":"CritasWang","email":"critas@outlook.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1,"words":301},"filePathRelative":"UserGuide/V1.1.x/Data-Concept/Compression.md","localizedDate":"July 10, 2023","autoDesc":true}');export{C as comp,T as data};
