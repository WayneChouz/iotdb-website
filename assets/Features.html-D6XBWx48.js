Users can connect to any node within the cluster for system access. The system remains operational and unaffected even during physical node outages or network failures. As physical nodes are added, removed, or face performance issues, IoTDB automatically manages load balancing for both computational and storage resources. Furthermore, it&#39;s compatible with heterogeneous environments, allowing servers of varying types and capabilities to form a cluster, with load balancing optimized based on the specific configurations of each server.</p>',19),n=[r];function s(l,c){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const p=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","Features.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/UserGuide/V1.2.x/IoTDB-Introduction/Features.html","title":"Features","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Features Flexible deployment.
